### Technologies Used

- [CleanURI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs)
- [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/)
- Vuejs
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### Lessons Learned

1. Starting with a mobile-first approach proved to be more effective for me.
2. Employing `navigator.clipboard.writeText(index)` enables copying text to the clipboard using JavaScript.
3. Utilizing the `:not()` pseudo-class in CSS allows styling all elements except those specified inside the `:not()` selector.
4. To use `mx-auto` properly, apply it to a block-level element with a defined width.
5. When confused, adding an outer div container can help organize layout.
6. `JSON.parse()` converts strings into JavaScript objects, often used for API responses.
7. In Vue.js, `computed` properties reactively update based on changes, while `watch` is used for side effects.
8. Utilized [CORS proxy](https://corsproxy.io/) to bypass CORS restrictions when accessing the public endpoint of CleanURL API.
